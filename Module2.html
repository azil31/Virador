      <p> I am Anna Liza R. Virador. I am currently living in Tobuan, Labrador, Pangasinan and I'm 20 years old. I was born on March 31, 2001 in Bagong Silangan, Quezon City. I'm the eldest in a brood of four, and I'm taking a BS Math major in CIT at Pangasinan State University, Lingayen Campus.<br><br>I grew up under the guidance of my grandparents. I have three siblings, and I am the eldest. I love playing online games like Mobile Legends. I also enjoy listening to music. I'm an introvert. My favorite color is green. I have two personalities. I'm an angel but also a devil. When someone is kind to me, I'll be kind too. However, I'm also the one you don't want to mess with because I'll make your life a living hell. I studied at <a href="http://localhost:8158/Second%20screen.html"> Tobuan Elementary School</a> when I was a kid. I had a lot of friends there, and I graduated from <a href ="http://localhost:8158/Third%20screen.html">Sual National High School</a>.<br><br>I describe myself as a bamboo tree because as I get older, I become stronger. I bravely face any challenges in my life and always remember that the higher your fear grows, the smaller you become. I won't give up on my dreams. It would take an army to stop me, and legends never surrender.</p>
